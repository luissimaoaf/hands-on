This repo contains my own notebooks as I follow the book "Hands-on Machine Learning" by Aurélien Géron chapter by chapter.
Some other notebooks that are included contain my solutions to the exercises, as well as more serious attempts at improving the models developed in each chapter.

The purpose of this project is to develop my Machine Learning skills while learning proper version control skills using git and GitHub, as well as improving my Linux dev setup in WSL2.
